Java script Assignment - Milinda 'ML' Liyanage

## Summary

* This assignment is to use a  java script to read data and display it in a table.
* The assignment is in two levels, which are independent of each other.
* The first level is to filter the data by the entered date.
* The second level is to add more filters for the selection and use them to filter the data.

### The following tasks were done for Level 1: 

* The data was read.
* A function was created to append the data on to the html table.
* A separate function was created to clear the data in the html table.
* Another function was created to run when the filter button was pressed (triggered).
* In the triggered function, the entered date was read and then the data was filtered before calling the append function.
* In the triggered function there is test to check if the is a value for the date, if not it will display the unfiltered table.

### Optional Level 2:

* Copied the entire Level 1 folder structure in to a new folder structure, called it UFO-level-2. 
* Edited the index.html file to include additional place holder for extra filters.
* Modified the filtering function to include the logic for the multiple filters.
* The filter works for any combination of the entered filter values.
* If all filters are cleared, then the unfiltered data is displayed.
